# Software Project Management - Final Project Backend

This project is a backend application built using Node.js and Express.js for my final project in the Software Project Management subject. It provides an API for the frontend React application.

This backend API is currently hosted on [Render](https://www.render.com/).

## Installation and Local Development

First, clone the repository:

\`\`\`
git clone https://github.com/PuvaanRaaj/testing.git
\`\`\`

Next, navigate into the project directory:

\`\`\`
cd your-backend-project-name
\`\`\`

Then, install the necessary dependencies:

\`\`\`
npm install
\`\`\`

Once the installation is complete, you can run the application in development mode with:

\`\`\`
npm start
\`\`\`

The application will run locally and can be accessed for testing using Postman or similar tools.

## Available Scripts

In addition to `npm start`, the following scripts are available:

### `npm test`

### `npm run build`
